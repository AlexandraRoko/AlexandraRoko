### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

- :computer: I'm a trained Social Data Scientist (@Oxford) and have a background in Public Policy (@Berlin), Physics (@Heidelberg) and Geography (@Heidelberg), too. 
- :school: I'm currently doing my MSc. in _Social Data Science_ at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk) and an MPP in _Public Policy_ at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) 
- :microscope: I'm interested in research topics within the Computational Social Sciences, Public Policy, Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing  

## Course work

Over the past last year, I was focussing on Network Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Analyics at Scale and Machiene Learning 

## Projects

In two of my last projects I was 

(1) researching how scientific concepts develop over time, focussing on Physics as a discipline, and              

(2) analysing forbidden triads, creativity, and collaborative behaviour on GitHub from a gendered perspective. 
The code can be found in the respective repositories below.
