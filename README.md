### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

- :computer: I'm a trained Social Data Scientist (@Oxford) and have a background in Public Policy (@Berlin), Physics (@Heidelberg) and Geography (@Heidelberg), too. 
- :school: I'm currently doing my [PhD studies](https://liu.se/en/employee/alero03) in _Computational Social Sciences/Analytical Sociology_ @LinkÃ¶ping Univeristy in Sweden.
- :microscope: I'm interested in research topics within Computational Social Sciences, Public Policy, Network Analysis and Natural Language Processing.  

## Course work

Over the past last year, I was focussing on Network Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Data Analyics at Scale and Machiene Learning.

## Projects

In two of my last projects I was 

(1) tracing the digital development of nations over time, 

(2) researching how scientific concepts develop over time, focussing on Physics as a discipline, and              

(3) analysing forbidden triads, creativity, and collaborative behaviour on GitHub from a gendered perspective.

          
The code of 2 and 3 can be found in the respective pinned repositories below.
